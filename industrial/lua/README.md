# Industrialism in Garry's Mod
This is a bit interesting. I tried making a machine-focused mod for an RP server but never finished it. All I really have to show is the entity base code and the HUD hint code. The entity base is the closest I ever got to something functional, in both meanings of the word functional.

## What I plan to do with this mod
I feel as though I am not done with this mod, and will start working on it again with a different mindset. It will be moddable and configurable, unlike anything I have done before. A perfect challenge is one you are passionate about and not afraid to keep working on.
