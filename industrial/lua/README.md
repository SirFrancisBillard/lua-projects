# Industrialism in Garry's Mod
This is a bit interesting. I tried making a machine-focused mod for an RP server but never finished it. All I really have to show is the entity base code and the HUD hint code. The entity base is the closest I ever got to something functional, in both meanings of the word functional.

## Modding this mod
This mod is fairly easy to create new items for. Here is a list of functions and useful data to create custom entities. Obviously, Lua knowledge is almost required if you want to do anything other than make a simple generator or battery.
There are 3 types of components in this mod (Technically 4, counting the base entity itself)
- Generator (gen)
- Battery (bat)
- Machine (mach)

~wip~
