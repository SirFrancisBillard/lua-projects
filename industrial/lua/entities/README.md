# Modding this mod
This mod is fairly easy to create new items for. Here is a list of functions and useful data to create custom entities. Obviously, Lua knowledge is almost required if you want to do anything other than make a simple generator or battery.
There are 3 types of components in this mod (Technically 4, counting the base entity itself)
- Generator (gen)
- Battery (bat)
- Machine (mach)
